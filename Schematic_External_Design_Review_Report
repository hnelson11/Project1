Schematic External Design Report

Define the design requirements: Start by defining the requirements for the electronic circuit, including any performance specifications, 
environmental constraints, and other factors that might impact the design.

Design Requirements: 

Circuit Topology:
Schematic was designed using KiCAD 6.0. Components used in circuit design 

Components used in schematic:

Circuit Analysis:

Power Requirements:

Create the circuit topology: Develop a schematic diagram of the electronic circuit, using a software tool such as Altium, Eagle, or KiCAD. Clearly label all components,
signals, and power supplies.

Select components: Choose the appropriate components for the circuit, taking into account factors such as cost, availability, performance, and compatibility
with other components.

Analyze the circuit: Use simulation tools to analyze the circuit and verify that it meets the design requirements. Evaluate performance metrics such as gain, 
bandwidth, noise, and distortion.

Design the power supply: Determine the power supply requirements for the circuit and design the necessary power supply circuitry. Consider issues such as voltage 
regulation, filtering, and protection.

Document the design: Create a detailed report that documents the design process, including the design requirements, circuit topology, component selection, 
simulation results, and power supply design. Include any relevant diagrams, charts, or tables that help to illustrate the design.

Review and revise: Have the design reviewed by others to ensure that it meets all necessary requirements and is free of errors. Revise the design as needed 
based on feedback.
